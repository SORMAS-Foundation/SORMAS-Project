Most git viewers abbreviate the first line after 50 characters. </li> <li>Keep changes in bugfixes clean and compact to be able to easily review them and leave the possibility to cherry-pick the changes to another branch to fix a previous version. Don't clean dirty code along the way if not really needed to fix the problem.</li> <li>If an issue requires a lot of code changes, consider breaking down these changes in logical steps. They are then easier to review, have more meaningful commit messages and partly deliver the intended value.</li> <li>Don't mix refactoring with functional changes (new functionality, changes on features, bugfixes) within the same commit, since it makes reviewing the changes much harder. Usually the refactoring of existing code has to happen beforehand in at least one separate commit. Refactoring includes e.g. cleaning up and restructuring code or renaming.</li> <li>If it helps, it is okay to have several branches and pull requests for the same ticket (usually one after another, sometimes to work in parallel or to prepare changes in advance).</li> <li>If there is a finding concerning an issue which has been already closed, it will be reopened if that version is not yet released.

This may e.g. happen if your pull request involves a lot of technical changes that we would like to merge together with other issues of the same nature or that could potentially break a lot of logic.

Please wait until the review is done; if you think that the review is taking too long, feel free to add a comment to the pull request as a reminder to the developer.</li> <li>The developer might request changes to the code. If that's the case, please implement the requested changes or answer to their change request if you have questions or don't agree with a specific part of the request.</li> <li>Once you've implemented all requested changes, please request another review by the assigned developer by clicking on the \"Re-request review\" icon next to their name. This step is necessary in order for the reviewer to be properly notified and for the pull request to show up in their review list again.</li> <li>As soon as the developer is happy with the submitted code (which might require multiple iterations of step 2 and 3, especially for larger pull requests), they will merge it into the development branch and close the pull request.</li> </ol> <p>Please adhere to the following principles when submitting pull requests:</p> <ol> <li>Only submit pull requests that are directly associated with one specific issue in our GitHub repository. If there is no issue for the development work that you would like to do, create one before you start working on it.</li> <li>Link your pull request to the issue(s) that they are associated with. This can be done either by using the \"Linked issues\" section at the right side when viewing a pull request, or by adding the keyword \"Closes\" or \"Fixes\" followed by the issue number to the pull request description (e.g. \"Fixes #1234\").</li> <li>Make sure that your pull request has a meaningful title. By default, GitHub will use your commit message as the title which might not be appropriate. In general, using the same name as the linked issue is a good rule of thumb.</li> <li>Try to not use force-push when updating an existing pull request (e.g. after changes have been requested or because you need to resolve merge conflicts).</li> <li>Ideally, your pull request should pass the checks done by the automatic CI pipeline before it gets reviewed.

However, every country naturally has its own requirements and processes, and in addition, there is a set of information that needs to be specified before a SORMAS instance can function properly. For this reason, there are a number of ways in which such a SORMAS instance can be configured and customized:</p> <ul> <li>Server Configuration: The basic server configuration is available as a .properties file, needs to be adjusted for every SORMAS instance, and is relevant for both production and development. This should be edited directly after installing the server.</li> <li>Feature Configuration: Most SORMAS features are optional and can be turned on or off directly in the database.</li> <li>Disease Configuration: SORMAS supports a large number of infectious diseases which can be enabled or disabled and further customized directly in the database.</li> <li>Deletion Configuration: SORMAS can be configured to automatically delete entities in the database.</li> <li>Infrastructure Data: Most infrastructure data (except countries and continents) are not shipped with SORMAS because they are country-specific. Importing the infrastructure data of your country (or creating some dummy data) is one of the first things you should do after setting up a SORMAS server.</li> </ul> <p>Beyond that, the Wiki contains even more customization options:</p> <ul> <li>Adding Disease Variants to a SORMAS Server</li> <li>Customizing the Login and About Pages</li> <li>Customizing the Name and Icon of the Android App</li> <li>Creating a SORMAS2SORMAS Certificate</li> </ul>"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#server-configuration","title":"Server Configuration","text":"<p>The general SORMAS configuration is stored in the sormas.properties file that you can find in your payara domain folder.

Some properties however are not commented, but also don't have a default value. It is strongly recommended to enter values for these properties because they are required for some parts of SORMAS to work correctly, or because they are very specific to your individual SORMAS instance.

Each user role is defined by a set of user rights, a jurisdiction that represents the area of responsibility and a set of notifications.

In SORMAS, a person entity represents a physically existing person. Cases and contacts represent epidemiological occurrences. When a person was in contact with an infectious environment, the person has a contact in SORMAS. When the person was in contact with such environments twice, it gets two contacts. When a person falls ill, it gets a case with the according disease. This means: In SORMAS, each contact and case relates to exactly one person. One person can have several contacts and cases, though. Follow up is done for a contact (or a case, which can be enabled in the SORMAS feature configuration). Contacts (or cases) initiate follow up. A person, though, either shows symptoms or not. It can not show symptoms for just one contact and not for the other. Thus, visits are related to all active contacts (and cases) of a person.
