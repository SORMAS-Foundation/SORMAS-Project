# Info texts
infoAddTestsToSample = To add tests to this sample, it has to be marked as received first.
infoBasicExport = Export the columns and rows that are shown in the table below.
infoCanceledBy = Canceled by %s using bulk action
infoCaseDate = By default, cases are filtered by the most relevant date available\:<br/><ul><li>Symptom onset date</li><li>Case reception date</li><li>Case report date</li></ul>This means that, when a case e.g. has a symptom onset date, only this date will be taken into account when searching the list for cases in the specified date range. You can specify a date type in the dropdown menu to instead specifically filter by this date.<br/><br/><b>Example\:</b> Case A has been created this week and therefore has a report date that lies in this week as well. However, Case A also has a symptom onset date that is set to last week (because it has been entered retrospectively). By default, when "Most relevant date" is selected and you have set the filter to only display cases of this week, Case A will not appear in the list because its symptom onset date lies in the previous week. For the case to appear in the list, you need to select "Case report date" which will result in only the report date being considered when filtering the list.
infoCaseIncidence = "Case incidence ratio" means the number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. You can check the map key to see the thresholds that define how the LGAs are colorized.
infoCaseMap = If cases are shown by home address and there are no GPS coordinates available for it, the coordinates of the location where the case has been reported are used instead.
infoContactDashboard = All Dashboard elements that display general information about contacts use the follow-up period of the respective contact, starting with the contact report date.
infoDatabaseExportTables = Please select the database tables you want to export.
infoDefineOutbreaks = Click on a button to define which LGAs of the state currently have an outbreak of a specific disease.
infoDetailedExport = Export the rows that are shown in the table below with an extended set of columns. This may take a while.
infoDownloadCaseImportTemplate = You can use this template .csv file to bring your data into a format SORMAS can read. Please do this every time you import data, never use a file you have downloaded before.
infoDownloadErrorReport = If there were any cases that could not be imported, you will be offered a .csv file containing all these cases as well as the error descriptions.
infoDownloadImportGuide = If this is your first time importing data into SORMAS, we strongly recommend to read the import guide first.
infoExportNoFilters = <b>Warning\:</b> No filters have been selected. Export may take a while.
infoImportCsvFile = Depending on the amount of cases you want to import, this may take a while. You will receive a notification when the import process has finished.
infoImportProcess = %d cases are being imported. The import process might take a while.<br/>You will be able to review and solve any errors after the import process has been completed.
infoImportSimilarity = One of the cases you tried to import has a similarity to one of the existing persons in the SORMAS database. Please choose an action to continue the import process.
infoLostToFollowUpBy = Set to lost to follow-up by %s using bulk action
infoNoAdditionalTests = No additional tests have been created for this sample
infoNoCasesFoundStatistics = No cases have been found for the selected filters and visualization options.
infoNoPathogenTests = There are no tests for this sample.
infoSampleAdditionalTesting = Please tick every type of additional test you would like to be performed on this sample.
infoSamplePathogenTesting = Please tick every type of pathogen test you would like to be performed on this sample.
infoStatisticsDisclaimer = All statistics on this page are aggregated data of the whole country. This includes cases you might not have read and write access to and therefore are not visible in the case directory.
infoStatisticsFilter = Add filters to restrict the aggregated data.<br/>If you use multiple filters, only cases that pass all restrictions will be aggregated.
infoStatisticsResults = Click the "Generate" button to create a new table, map or chart.
infoSurveillanceDashboard = All Dashboard elements that display cases (the "New Cases" statistics, the Epidemiological Curve and the Case Status Map) use the onset date of the first symptom for the date/epi week filter. If this date is not available, the reception date or date of report is used instead.
infoUserEmail = Used to send E-Mail notifications.
infoUserPhoneNumber = Used to send SMS notifications. Needs to contain country code.
infoWeeklyReportsView = <b>Number of officer/informant reports</b> is the total number of reports that were submitted by the officers/informants associated with the displayed state or officer this week.<br/><br/> <b>Percentage</b> is the percentage of officers/informants that submitted their report for the respective week.<br/><br/> <b>Number of officers/informants zero reports</b> is the amount of zero reports, i.e. submitted reports with no cases. These are included in the total number of reports.<br/><br/> <b>Officer/Informant report submission</b> is either the date the report has been submitted at or a hint that no report has been submitted for this week yet.
