# Info texts
infoAddTestsToSample = To add a test result to this sample, it has to be marked as received first.

infoAssigneeMissingEmail = The user assigned to this task does not have an e-mail address provided, and will therefore not be notified.
infoAssigneeMissingEmailOrPhoneNumber = The user assigned to this task does not have an e-mail address nor a phone number provided, and will therefore not be notified.
infoBasicExport = Export the columns and rows that are shown in the table below.
infoCanceledBy = Canceled by %s using bulk action
infoCaseDate = By default, cases are filtered by the most relevant date available\:<br/><ul><li>Symptom onset date</li><li>Case report date</li></ul>This means that, when a case e.g. has a symptom onset date, only this date will be taken into account when searching the list for cases in the specified date range. You can specify a date type in the dropdown menu to instead specifically filter by this date.<br/><br/><b>Example\:</b> Case A has been created this week and therefore has a report date that lies in this week as well. However, Case A also has a symptom onset date that is set to last week (because it has been entered retrospectively). By default, when "Most relevant date" is selected and you have set the filter to only display cases of this week, Case A will not appear in the list because its symptom onset date lies in the previous week. For the case to appear in the list, you need to select "Case report date" which will result in only the report date being considered when filtering the list.
infoCaseIncidence = "Case incidence proportion" means the number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. You can check the map key to see the thresholds that define how the districts are colorized.
infoCaseMap = If cases are shown by home address and there are no GPS coordinates available for it, the coordinates of the location where the case has been reported are used instead.

infoImportSimilarity = One of the cases you tried to import is similar to an already existing case in the SORMAS database. Please check whether the case to import is a duplicate of any of the cases in the list and, if so, select that case and confirm.
infoLostToFollowUpBy = Set to lost to follow-up by %s using bulk action
infoNoAdditionalTests = No additional tests have been created for this sample
infoNoCasesFoundStatistics = No cases have been found for the selected filters and visualization options.
infoCaseIncidenceNotPossible = The following regions have missing population data\:<br/><br/>%s.<br/><br/>As a result, case incidence cannot be calculated and case counts are displayed instead.
infoCaseIncidenceMissingPopulationData = The following regions and/or districts have missing population data\:<br/><br/>%s.<br/><br/>Incidence proportion cannot be calculated for these regions and/or districts.

infoWeeklyReportsView = <b>Number of officer/informant reports</b> is the total number of reports that were submitted by the officers/informants associated with the displayed region or officer this week.<br/><br/> <b>Percentage</b> is the percentage of officers/informants that submitted their report for the respective week.<br/><br/> <b>Number of officers/informants zero reports</b> is the amount of zero reports, i.e. submitted reports with no cases. These are included in the total number of reports.<br/><br/> <b>Officer/Informant report submission</b> is either the date the report has been submitted at or a hint that no report has been submitted for this week yet.
infoMergingExplanation = This view is designed to assist you in detecting and merging duplicate cases. Cases are always displayed as pairs, the case with the earlier creation date being on top.<br/><br/>You can use the creation date filter to only view potential duplicates that were created in a specific time period. The creation date is automatically generated when a case is entered into SORMAS and can not be changed by users. Therefore, once you have reviewed all duplicates from a specific time period in the past, you will never have to do it again as there will be no new cases created during this time frame.<br/><br/>Please note that most likely not all displayed cases are actual duplicates. There is the potential for false positives, so <b>please thoroughly review the cases before merging them\!</b> In addition to the information provided in the table, you can also click on the IDs of the cases to open them in a new tab. Keep in mind that it is much worse to falsely merge unique cases together than to have some duplicates in the system.
infoMergingMergeDescription = Choose this option only if you are <b>sure that the two cases are the same\!</b> You should click on this button next to the case with the most recent or more complete information. Click on the IDs of the cases to open them in new tabs in order to view all their data. When the case you chose is missing information that is present in the other case, it will be updated. Also, contacts, samples, tasks and case management information will be transfered. Afterwards, the case you did not choose will be deleted.
infoMergingPickDescription = Clicking on this button will simply delete the case that was not picked. However, no information will be copied to the case that remains active. All contacts, samples and tasks will be lost as well. Choose this option if you are sure that both cases are the same, but the other case has not been updated with any information that needs to be transfered to the one that remains active.
infoMergingHideDescription = Choose this option if you are not sure whether the two cases are the same or if you know that they are not. This will hide the case pair from the list. Please note that, when you refresh the view or come back to it later, it will re-appear as long as you don't choose a different time period in the creation date filter.
infoHowToMergeCases = You can choose between two options when reviewing potentially duplicate cases\:
infoCalculateCompleteness = The <i>Calculate Completeness</i> button on top can be used to calculate the completeness values for all cases in the table. This is only necessary if there are cases in the list that do not yet have a completeness value. Normally, this value is automatically updated whenever the details of a case or one of its contacts or samples change.
infoCaseCompleteness = Completeness is a measurement of how much vital data has already been entered into the case. This is composed of the following, weighted by their importance\:<br/><ul><li>Has the case been classified?</li><li>Has the case been investigated?</li><li>Has at least one sample been taken?</li><li>Has at least one symptom been documented?</li><li>Has at least one contact been created?</li><li>Is there an outcome for the case?</li><li>Does the case have a birth date or age?</li><li>Does the case have a sex?</li><li>Has an onset date been specified?</li></ul>
infoCompletenessMerge = You can use this measurement to get an idea about which case you should use as the one that remains active when merging. However, please make sure that you still have a detailed look at both cases to avoid mistakes.
infoMergeIgnoreRegion = Selecting this option excludes the region as a criteria for detecting duplicates. Merging and picking are deactivated here because the probability of a real duplicate beyond region boundaries is very low. If a real duplicate is detected, this case can be deleted manually via the case directory.
infoCustomExport = In this view, you can create and save export configurations with customized sets of columns. Saving these configurations allows you to quickly export only the information that you're interested, without having to manually edit the resulting CSV file afterwards. Please click on the blue export button next to one of your configurations or create a new configuration by using the button to the right.

If you want to edit the data, please use the export function, copy the data you want to change into the import template, edit it, and import the template file containing the changed data.
infoPopulationCollectionDate = Please indicate the date the population data you want to import was collected on. If you only know the year, please choose the 1st of January of that year.
