You can specify a date type in the dropdown menu to instead specifically filter by this date.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b> Case A has been created this week and therefore has a report date that lies in this week as well. However, Case A also has a symptom onset date that is set to last week (because it has been entered retrospectively). By default, when \"Most relevant date\" is selected and you have set the filter to only display cases of this week, Case A will not appear in the list because its symptom onset date lies in the previous week. For the case to appear in the list, you need to select \"Case report date\" which will result in only the report date being considered when filtering the list.
