You can specify a date type in the dropdown menu to instead specifically filter by this date.<br/><br/><b>Example\:</b> Case A has been created this week and therefore has a report date that lies in this week as well. However, Case A also has a symptom onset date that is set to last week (because it has been entered retrospectively). By default, when "Most relevant date" is selected and you have set the filter to only display cases of this week, Case A will not appear in the list because its symptom onset date lies in the previous week. For the case to appear in the list, you need to select "Case report date" which will result in only the report date being considered when filtering the list.

infoMergingExplanation = This view is designed to assist you in detecting and merging duplicate cases.

The creation date is automatically generated when a case is entered into SORMAS and can not be changed by users. Therefore, once you have reviewed all duplicates from a specific time period in the past, you will never have to do it again as there will be no new cases created during this time frame.<br/><br/>Please note that most likely not all displayed cases are actual duplicates. There is the potential for false positives, so <b>please thoroughly review the cases before merging them\!</b> In addition to the information provided in the table, you can also click on the IDs of the cases to open them in a new tab. Keep in mind that it is much worse to falsely merge unique cases together than to have some duplicates in the system.
infoContactMergingExplanation = This view is designed to assist you in detecting and merging duplicate contacts. Contacts are always displayed as pairs, the contact with the earlier creation date being on top.<br/><br/>You can use the creation date filter to only view potential duplicates that were created in a specific time period.
