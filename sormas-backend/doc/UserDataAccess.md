# User data access

## Basics
In general data access & synchronisation is based on the following rules:

* hospital informant: all data associated to the facility (cases)
* community informant: all data associated to the community (cases)
* officers: all data associated to the district (cases, events)
* supervisors: all data associated to the region
* observers: all data associated to their jurisdiction (nation, region or district)
* port health users: - all data associated to their jurisdiction (nation, region or district), that is seeing data associated to their point of entry, only national port health users see data from multiple points of entry
                     - can only see port health cases, no matter the user jurisdiction
* all data that is created by the user
* all data associated to the data created by the user (contacts, tasks, persons, visits)
* special case: if an officer has access to a task or contact whose case/event/contact is not available, the association link should be inactive
* user rights (e.g. allow seeing cases) and mapping of user roles to a jurisdiction level is documented in the [user rights table](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project/tree/development/sormas-api/src/main/resources/doc/SORMAS_User_Rights.xlsx)
