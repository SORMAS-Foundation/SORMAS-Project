# Basics
In general data access & synchronisation is based on the following rules:

* hospital informant: all data associated to the facility (cases)
* community informant: all data associated to the community (cases)
* officers: all data associated to the district (cases, events)
* supervisors: all data associated to the region
* all data that is created by the user
* all data associated to the above data (contacts, tasks, persons, visits)
* special case: if an officer has access to a task or contact whose case/event/contact is not available, the association link should be inactive
