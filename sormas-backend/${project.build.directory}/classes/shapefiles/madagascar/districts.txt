ABSTRACT (A brief narrative summary of the content of the dataset):
Madagascar District Boundaries (Fivondronana), Administrative Level 2.  
Cleaned & merged from the commune (adm3) shape data obtained from Madagascar BNGRC (National Disaster Management Office) in 2011, based on the District name field, by OCHA.
Differences from SALB/GAUL Boundaries: 
There are 111 districts in the SALB/GAUL Boundaries in comparison to 114 districts in this shapefile. 
The old Fianarantsoa II district in SALB has been divided into 3 districts, namely Isandra, Lalangina & Vohibato Districts. 
The old Betafo district has been divided into 2 districts, namely Betafo & Mandoto Districts.
(Toamasina II District falls in Atsinanana Region not  Analanjirofo region as in SALB/GAUL)
Antananarivo-Avaradrano and Antananarivo-Atsimondrano district names were inverted in the commune (adm3) data in comparison to SALB/GAUL and were therefore changed around in the district shape.
