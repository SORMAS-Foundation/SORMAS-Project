## Test - DownloadAll

This test checks if an export is working. For this to work the used browser needs to be confgured to use a defined download path and to download the file immediately.

Currently this is configured only with Firefox.

How to configure other browser can be found in the test itself and on this site <https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/introduction-to-desired-capabilities.html>
