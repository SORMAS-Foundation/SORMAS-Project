# SORMAS-Open
SORMAS stands for “Surveillance, Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System“, developed during the West African Ebola pandemic 2014/15. SORMAS is an early warning and management system based on flexible mobile telephone apps in combination with modern cloud technology, enabling even countries equipped with only limited information and communication technologies (ICT)  •   To record infection outbreaks without delay,  •   To monitor complex processes to interrupt infection chains and  •   To ensure continuous analyses of the epidemiological situation
