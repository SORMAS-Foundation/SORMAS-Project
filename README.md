# SORMAS-Open

SORMAS stands for *Surveillance, Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System*. A first prototype was developed during the West African Ebola pandemic 2014/15. SORMAS is an early warning and management system based on
- flexible mobile telephone apps in combination with
- modern cloud technology, 

enabling even countries equipped with only limited information and communication technologies (ICT) to:

- record infection outbreaks without delay,
- monitor complex processes to interrupt infection chains and  
- ensure continuous analyses of the epidemiological situation.
