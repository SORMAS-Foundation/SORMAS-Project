# SORMAS

**SORMAS** (Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System) is an open source eHealth system - consisting of separate web and mobile apps - that is geared towards optimizing the processes used in monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and responding to outbreak situations.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### How Does it Work?
You can give SORMAS a try on our demo server at <https://demo.sormas.org>!

### How Can I Get Involved?
Read through our [*Contributing Readme*](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and contact us at info@sormas.org to learn how you can help to drive the development of SORMAS forward,
or check out our [Discussions](https://github.com/sormas-foundation/SORMAS-Project/discussions) to get development support from the core developers and other community members.
SORMAS is a community-driven project, and we'd love to have you on board!

If you want to contribute to the code, please strictly adhere to the [*Development Environment*](docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md) guide to ensure that everything is set up correctly.
Please also make sure that you've read the [*Development Contributing Guidelines*](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-contributing-guidelines) before you start to develop.

### How Can I Report a Bug or Request a Feature?
If you want to report a **security issue**, please read and follow our [*Security Policies*](docs/SECURITY.md). For bugs without security implications, change and feature requests, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/sormas-foundation/SORMAS-Project/issues/new/choose) and
read the [*Submitting an Issue*](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-an-issue) guide for more detailed instructions. We appreciate your help!

### Which Browsers and Android Versions are Supported?
SORMAS officially supports and is tested on **Chromium-based browsers** (like Google Chrome) and **Mozilla Firefox**, and all Android versions starting from **Android 7.0** (Nougat). In principle, SORMAS should be usable with all web browsers that are supported by Vaadin 8 (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer 11; see <https://vaadin.com/faq>).

Making use of the SORMAS web application through a mobile device web browser is possible and acceptable also in countries that are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as enforced by the European Union. However, in such countries that are subject to the GDPR, the Android application (.apk file) for SORMAS should not be used on mobile devices until further notice.

### Is there a ReST API documentation?
Yes! Please download the [latest release](https://github.com/sormas-foundation/SORMAS-Project/releases/latest) and copy the content of /deploy/openapi/sormas-rest.yaml to an editor that generates a visual API documentation(e.g. <https://editor.swagger.io/>).
A runtime Swagger documentation of the External Visits Resource (used by external symptom journals such as CLIMEDO or PIA) is available at ``<<host>>/sormas-rest/openapi.json`` or ``<<host>>/sormas-rest/openapi.yaml``

### Who is responsible for Data Protection and Data Security?
We herewith explicitly would like to draw your attention to the fact, that the respective public health agency running SORMAS is in charge of data security and data protection and has to ensure compliance with national data protection and data security regulations in their respective jurisdiction.
It has to ensure that state-of-the art requirements for data protection and data security are fulfilled. All those prerequisites and examinations have to be done in the context of the country and its respective legal framework.
For these reasons, HZI cannot take the responsibility from the respective public health agency running the SORMAS systems and is not liable for any violation of data protection of the agency as the data generated by SORMAS belong to that very agency.
