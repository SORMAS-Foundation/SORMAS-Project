## General info

This automation project aims to help web developers to detect and prevent any
issues that might block successful web development.

## Technologies

* GUICE - sharing state between steps in Cucumber-JVM
* CUCUMBER - software tool used for acceptance tests written in a
  behavior-driven development style
* LOMBOK - Java library helps to avoid repetitive code
* GRADLE - build automation tool
* JAVA FAKER  - project dependency generates random data for test scenarios
* Slf4j - Java logging framework
* ALLURE - test report tool

## Setup

* Clone the project and open only the *sormas-e2e-tests* subproject

* Install Java JDK 11 on your local machine

    ```text
    1. https://sdkman.io/install
    2. sdk install java 11.0.11-zulu
  OR 
  Download the java zulu 11 from https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk
    ```

* Install Gradle
* Install Allure(To check this run `allure serve` from Intellij command line)
* Install IntelliJ IDEA please follow the steps [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* Launch IntelliJ IDEA and click on `Import project`

  ![config](./images/sc1.png)  

* As a new window is opened select `build.gradle`  in the project directory and
  click `Open`  
  Alternatively go to IDea Preferences and search for `gradle`

  ![config](./images/sc2.png)
* Open `Preferences` -> `Plugins` and install `Cucumber for Java` plugin

   ![config](./images/sc4.png)
* Open `Preferences` -> `Compiler` and enable checkbox `Annotation processing`

  ![config](./images/sc6.png)

* Open `Preferences` -> `Plugins` and install `Lombok` plugin

## Test case design

A design pattern is implemented based on a behavior-driven development style.
Cucumber creates specification called a feature file which consists of
multiple scenarios. Each scenario is a list of steps written in plain text, and
they must follow the syntax called Gherkin. Cucumber requires a set of step
definitions which map steps for the action should be performed. Feature files
can be taken as a base for living documentation and executable specification.

> Feature file example:

```gherkin
  Scenario: Create a new event
Given I log in with the user
And I click on the Events button from navbar
When I click on the NEW EVENT button
Then I create a new event
```

> Step definition file example:

```gherkin
    Given("I click on the Log In button",
() -> webDriverHelpers.clickOnWebElementBySelector(LoginPage.LOGIN_BUTTON));
```

## Test execution

Gradle is a management system tool for the project build and dependencies
configuration. Project contains `build.gradle` at a root level.
This file a build configuration script defines a project and its tasks.

> Execution from a terminal window example:

````gradle

gradlew clean startTests -Dcucumber.tags="@Login" -Denvironment=performance

````

## Reporting

* Allure is a test report tool provides a nice visual representation of executed
tests. Reporting requires [test execution](#test-execution) to generate some
test report data.
* Open `allureReport` folder in a project and click on `index.html`. A new
generated report should be opened in the default browser.
* After running the tests you will be able to find the allure report in the root
of the project, in the allureReports folder.
* You can add @issue=ticketNumber
to link GitHub bugs/tickets
