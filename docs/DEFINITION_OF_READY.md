# Definition of Ready

In order to be eligible for being implemented in the current iteration, an issue has to be marked with the `ready` label. This label indicates that the issue fulfills our Definition of Ready, which consists of the following requirements:

- A representative title that summarizes what the issue is about
- A dedicated ticket type according to the content of the issue:Â feature, change, bug, or task
- All mandatory sections of the issue template are filled in with unambiguous information, i.e. without any points of discussion
- Features/changes that involve significant innovative UI/UX work (e.g. new sections, new UI elements, new workflows) provide mockups that visually describe how the feature/change is supposed to look like
- Issues that are technically complex have at least rough implementation details
- The issue is appropriately labeled, i.e. with the affected part of the application (android-app, vaadin-app, or backend) and the functional and/or technical area(s) it affects

Ideally, change and feature requests also have a story point estimation, specified in brackets after their title.
