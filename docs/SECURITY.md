## Reporting a Security Bug

Our team and community take all security bugs in SORMAS seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of SORMAS. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.
Unfortunately, SORMAS does not offer a paid bug bounty programme or other forms of compensation.

Report security bugs by emailing at **security@sormas.org**.

We will acknowledge your email and follow up with a response within 10 business days, or explain why a reply may take longer. The response will indicate the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.


## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
  released as fast as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
